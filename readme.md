# Pokhara University Programming in Java Solutions (2013-2022)

## Overview

Welcome to the official repository for the Programming in Java course at Pokhara University. This repository houses a collection of code-based solutions for university exams spanning from 2013 to 2022.

## Structure

To maintain consistency and organization, we follow specific naming conventions and folder structure:

- Each class name should commence with either 'Fall' or 'Spring' followed by the respective year (e.g. Fall2022).
- For each course chapter, a dedicated folder is created within the 'src' directory.

## Guidelines

Please adhere to the following guidelines when contributing to this repository:

1. **Organize by Chapters**: When adding solutions for new questions, categorize them according to the relevant course chapters. Create folders if needed for better organization.

2. **Naming Conventions**: It is crucial to strictly follow both this repository's naming conventions and Java's naming conventions to maintain uniformity and readability.

3. **Code Quality**: We prioritize clean and well-documented code. Please ensure that the solutions you submit adhere to best practices in coding.
4. **Commit Messages**: When making commits, use clear and descriptive commit messages. A good commit message succinctly explains the purpose of the commit. Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format for meaningful commit messages.
